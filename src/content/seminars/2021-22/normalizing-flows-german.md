- **Abstract**:

Generative models have proved to excel at a variety of tasks such as image generation, restoration, style transfer or motion forecasting. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) are common choices. Lately, flow-based models (normalizing flows) have attracted the attention of the research community due to their capabilities of modeling the exact likelihood of the data to model. This knowledge of the exact likelihood makes it a better choice than its competitors in some cases. In this talk, I will present some of these situations in the context of behavior forecasting.
